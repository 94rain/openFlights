  At the first week, we decided to use the OpenFlight as our dataset and implement BFS traversal, Dijkstra's algorithm and PageRank algorithm in a directed graph. Moreover, everyone signed up the contract and drew up project proposal. At the same time, we have splitted up equal workload to everyone.

  We built the basic graph framwork for our project. During the time, we met some trouble on how to parse airport data to our graph, but finally we fixed these bug.
  We implemented route as our graph's edge, airport as our graph's node and Openflight as our final graph. Liwen Sun added MakeFile and implemented our first algorithm BFS. Shuyang Ji added basic test cases for Openflight graph and BFS. They updated README to include necessary commands for compiling, runing and testing our project.

  We calculate the distance be
=======
 We implement the Dijkstra class. It includes 3 method, the constructor, get_path and get distance. The constructor accepts a starting airport and calculate the shortest distance between all of the other airports and the start point storing it into a map. Then get_path and get_distance method would accept the Airport format of destination and return the coresponding value(distance and the best path to the destination). Zhekai Ge implements Dijkstra.h and Dijkstra.cpp and Yihan Zhang write the test case for the algorithm.
