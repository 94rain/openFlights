## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

    We expect to meet once or twice every week every Tuesday or Thursday from 5-7 PM using Zoom or WeChat. 
    
    We expect everyone to come to the meeting prepared, attend meetings on time, listen attentively and be open to share their own opinions. If a team member cannot come to the meeting, they will need to inform other team members at least one day in advance to reschedule the meeting.
    
    There will be a note taker starting from Liwen Sun (liwens3) to write Development Log weekly.
    
2. **Assistance** 

   To get assistance, each team member can be contacted through email, Discord, or WeChat. We will mostly use WeChat for real-time communications for simple and quick assistance. For sophisticated issues, we will discuss during meeting times or schedule additional meetings if necessary.

   When we are immediately available, we expect the average response time to be 5 minutes. In other time periods, outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to messages within 12 hours. 

3. **Respect** 

   We encourage open expression of different ideas. We all agree that we will utilize our own skills to contribute to the project. We will ensure every member has a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project. Each member will show respect for othersâ€™ ideas about our project.

   We will avoid placing blame when things go wrong and instead discuss and explore how it can be improved.

## Collaboration
1. **Work Distribution** 

   We expect full participation from each team member. Everyone will be assigned workload equally weekly. Work distribution may be adjusted based on the progress and the actual workload of each part. If someone meets trouble during his assigned job and cannot figure it out by himself, we will help him together. 


2. **Time Commitment** 

   Each team member is expected to commit 5-6 hours every week on our project. If someone has special issues which lead to time conflict, we will together figure out how to reassign our work and adjust our origin schedule to make up for the missed time.

3. **Conflict Resolution** 

   We will peacefully communicate with each other if a conflict resolution happens. We will send emails or directly talk with each other in person to solve this conflict. If one of our team members does not finish his assigned job, we will together help him and give more detailed suggestions about how to further our project. If there exists serious disagreement among us, we will contact our assigned mentor right away.
